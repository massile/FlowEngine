# FlowEngine

A 3D Engine written in OpenGL just for fun. :smile:

## Libraries

This project uses [GLFW 3](http://www.glfw.org/index.html), [GLEW](http://glew.sourceforge.net/) and OpenGL to run.

## Results and expectations (for now)
 
  - [x] Window system
  - [ ] Keyboard & mouse input
  - [x] Shaders
  - [x] Modern way to load a mesh (with buffers & vertex arrays)
  - [ ] Mesh loading (.obj format)
  - [ ] Textures
  - [ ] Cameras
  - [ ] Coordinate system
  - [ ] Lighting ([Phong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phong_shading))
  - [ ] Material system
  - [ ] Mesh loading with skeleton ([.sls format](https://github.com/massile/sls-blender-exporter))
  - [ ] Advanced lighting ([CookTorrance](http://www.codinglabs.net/article_physically_based_rendering_cook_torrance.aspx))
  - [ ] Shadow mapping
  - [ ] Normal mapping
